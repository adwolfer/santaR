\title{santaR: A package for Short AsyNchronous Time-series Analysis in R}
\description{
\pkg{santaR} provides a graphical and automated pipeline for the analysis of short time-series studies.
It enables the detection of significantly altered time trajectories between study groups, while
being resilient to missing values and unsynchronised measurements.
}
\details{
The main functions of \pkg{santaR} are \code{\link{santaR_start_GUI}} to start the graphical user
interface, as well as \code{\link{santaR_auto_fit}} and \code{\link{santaR_auto_summary}} for
automated command line analysis and reporting. Refer to the vignettes for graphical user
interface and command line tutorials.
